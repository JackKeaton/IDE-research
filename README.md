# ATOM IDE

### Why the ATOM IDE is a good idea.

#### Summary
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is an IDE that completely shapes to your needs and preferences, wether you like to work alone or in a group, like a heavily customised editor, or keep it clean. With a massive amount of extensions, Github support built in and a huge support base both from Atom itself and people outside it, Atom does not leave you wanting.

### Pros and Cons

#### Autocorrect
As a junior web developer, typing fast isn't an issue, typing correctly isn't an issue. But doing both at the same time tends to be a challenge. Sooner or later I overlook a typo and have to backtrack. For now, that's easy. But finding a bug in a haystack only get's harder. The autocorrect prevents that often enough.

#### Customisation
There are ridiculous amounts of packages, themes and customisations.

#### Collaboration
Imagine working on a project. Now imagine working on a project like we worked on the template earlier
